        <p>
          I'm a researcher who uses best practices from behavioural science, implementation science,
          and design science to improve the development and evaluation of health-related innovations.
          I use mixed methods research approaches and work closely with stakeholders (e.g., patients,
          caregivers, and providers) to ensure innovative solutions meet usersâ€™ needs.
